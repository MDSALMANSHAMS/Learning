    "In computer vision, loss functions are used to evaluate how well a model's predictions match the ground truth. Here are some major types of loss functions commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Regression tasks (e.g., image reconstruction, super-resolution).\n",
    "   - **Formula**: MSE= 1/N ∑i=(1,N)(yi− y`i)^2\n",
    "   - **Description**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted values and true values. It’s sensitive to large errors but not robust to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Cross-Entropy Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Classification tasks (e.g., image classification).\n",
    "   - **Formula**: CE Loss = -∑i=(1,N)yi.log(y`i)\n",
    "   - **Description**: Measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution. It is the most commonly used loss for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Binary classification (e.g., object detection, segmentation).\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{BCE Loss} = - [y \\log(\\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \\log(1 - \\hat{y})] \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: A special case of cross-entropy used for binary classification, where the target is either 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Dice Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Image segmentation tasks (e.g., medical image segmentation).\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Dice Loss} = 1 - \\frac{2 \\cdot |A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B|} \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Measures the overlap between two sets. It is particularly useful for evaluating segmentation quality in imbalanced datasets, as it gives higher weight to smaller regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Huber Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Regression tasks with outliers (e.g., object tracking, pose estimation).\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     L_\\delta(y, \\hat{y}) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "     \\frac{1}{2} (y - \\hat{y})^2 & \\text{for } |y - \\hat{y}| \\leq \\delta \\\\\n",
    "     \\delta |y - \\hat{y}| - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^2 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Combines MSE and absolute error to be more robust to outliers. It is less sensitive to large errors than MSE but still sensitive to small errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Focal Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Addressing class imbalance (e.g., object detection in imbalanced datasets).\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \n",
    "     \\[ \\text{Focal Loss} = -\\alpha (1 - p_t)^\\gamma \\log(p_t) \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Modifies the cross-entropy loss to focus more on hard-to-classify examples by down-weighting the easy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **IoU (Intersection over Union) Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Object detection and segmentation tasks.\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{IoU} = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|} \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes or masks. A higher IoU indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Triplet Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Face recognition, metric learning.\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[ L_{\\text{triplet}} = \\max(d(a, p) - d(a, n) + \\alpha, 0) \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Ensures that an anchor image and a positive image (same class) are closer in embedding space than the anchor and a negative image (different class), with a margin \\(\\alpha\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Contrastive Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Metric learning, face verification.\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     L_{\\text{contrastive}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( y \\cdot D^2 + (1 - y) \\cdot \\max(0, m - D)^2 \\right)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: Similar to triplet loss, it learns the similarity or dissimilarity between pairs of images, minimizing the distance for similar pairs and maximizing it for dissimilar pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Smooth L1 Loss**\n",
    "   - **Used for**: Object detection (e.g., bounding box regression).\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Smooth L1 Loss}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "     0.5x^2 & \\text{if } |x| < 1 \\\\\n",
    "     |x| - 0.5 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "     \\end{cases}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Description**: A combination of L2 loss for small values and L1 loss for large values. It is less sensitive to outliers than L2 loss and helps in bounding box regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Regression Tasks**: MSE, Huber Loss.\n",
    "- **Classification Tasks**: Cross-Entropy, Binary Cross-Entropy.\n",
    "- **Segmentation Tasks**: Dice Loss, IoU Loss.\n",
    "- **Object Detection**: Focal Loss, Smooth L1 Loss.\n",
